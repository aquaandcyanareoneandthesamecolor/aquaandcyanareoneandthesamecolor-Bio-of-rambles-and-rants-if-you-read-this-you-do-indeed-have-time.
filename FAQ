Q: Do you play valorant/lol/minecraft/apex/cod/halo/zelda/pubg/roblox/overwatch/supersmashbro/gta/fortnite/osu/dota/most of the game y’all talk about?
A: No, I don't. All I play is shown in a list in the general file. (the reason I don't play is cause I know I will suck anyways so why try, but some do seem fun, so one day).

I don’t remember people asking me more than that.
